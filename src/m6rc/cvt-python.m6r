Target: Instructions for use of metaphor
    Please analyze the code below and generate a version of the same application in python.  Match the python module
    names to the names used in the C++ code.

    Scope: Implementation and dependencies
        As an engineer working with the application, I want the application to be easy to use and understand,
        so I can maintain and enhance it over time.

        Scope: Implement in Python 3
            The application will be written in the latest version of Python 3.

        Scope: Indentation of code
            Code must be indented by 4 spaces.

        Scope: Use of docstrings
            Use docstrings to describe all modules, classes, and functions.

        Scope: Use of comments
            Use additional comments to describe any complex logic.

        Scope: PEP 8 imports
            The import list in any module should follow PEP 8 guidelines.

        Scope: Avoid unnecessary elif and else statements
            Do not use elif or else statements if the preceding statement returns.

    Scope: Previous version
        An implementation of the current application written in C++ is provided here.
