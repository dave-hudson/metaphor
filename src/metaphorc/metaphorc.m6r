Goal:
    Build a compiler to process files written in a language, Metaphor, allowing them to be used to drive a dialogue
    with an LLM.

    Story:
        As: a software product designer
        I: want to describe the intent of a software product to an LLM,
        So: it can help me build and refine the software components.

    Story:
        Previous version.

        Require:
            An implementation of the current compiler is provided here.  It may not accurately reflect the
            requirements stated previously, in which case it will need to be modified to support them.
