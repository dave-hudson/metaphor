Target:
    I have a single page application website and want to pre-render all the pages so I can allow the website to be crawled by spiders that cannot render JavaScript.

    As a website developer, I want to pre-render all the pages of my website, so I can allow the website to be
    crawled by spiders that cannot render JavaScript.

    Scope: Environment and dependency setup

        Scope:
            The tool must be compatible with Node.js version 14.x or later and headless Google Chrome (current version).

        Scope:
            Use the latest available stable version of puppeteer for rendering.

        Scope:
            Use the latest available stable version of yargs for command line options.

        Scope:
            Use the latest available stable version of yargs for command line options.

        Scope:
            Use the latest available stable version of axios to handle the HTTP requests.

        Scope:
            Use the latest available stable version of fast-xml-parser to handle the XML parsing.

        Scope:
            Any package dependencies that you might need must be explicitly stated in these requirements.  If you need to use a dependency that is not listed here then ask for approval or use a different approach.

    Scope: Rendering

        Scope:
            Once the directory structure is in place and all old index.html files have been deleted, render all the pages.

        Scope:
            The tool should parallelize rendering operations.

    Scope: Retry Mechanism

        Scope:
            Implement a retry mechanism for failed render attempts with a default of 3 retries.

        Scope:
            The retry mechanism should be applied to invocations of puppeteer as well as for network failures.

        Scope:
            Allow this to be configurable with the --max-retries parameter.

        Scope:
            If a failure occurs, wait one second before attempting the retry.

        Scope:
            The tool should exit with an error status if any page fails to render after retries.
