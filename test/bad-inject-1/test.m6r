Target:
    I have a single page application website and want to pre-render all the pages so I can allow the website to be crawled by spiders that cannot render JavaScript.

    Scope:
        Usage Information

        Scope:
            If invoked with invalid parameters, display correct usage information.
        Scope:
            Include a -h parameter to display a help message with all valid parameters and their usage.

        Inject: test/bad-include-1/include.m6r
        Inject: test/bad-include-1/include.m6r

        Scope:
            Code quality

            Scope:
                Use JSDoc annotations for all functions.
            Scope:
                Use 4 spaces for indentation in the source code.
            Scope:
                Where any functions may throw errors, include try/catch blocks to handle those error conditions.
            Scope:
                For code style, do not use an "else" if the previous block in an if statement ends with a "return" statement.
